Question:

When users post an update on social media,such as a URL, image, status update
etc., other users in their network are able to view this new post on their news
feed. Users can also see exactly when the post was published, i.e, how many
hours, minutes or seconds ago.

Since sometimes posts are published and viewed in different time zones, this
can be confusing. You are given two timestamps of one such post that a user can
see on his newsfeed in the following format:
    Day dd Mon yyyy hh:mm:ss +xxxx

Here +xxxx represents the time zone. Your task is to print the absolute
difference (in seconds) between them.

Input Format:
    * The first line contains T, the number of testcases.
    * Each testcase contains 2 lines, representing time t1 and time t2.

Constraints:
    * Input contains only valid timestamp
    * year <= 3000

Output Format:
    Print the absolute difference (t1 - t2) in seconds.

Sample Input:
    2
    Sun 10 May 2015 13:54:36 -0700
    Sun 10 May 2015 13:54:36 -0000
    Sat 02 May 2015 19:54:36 +0530
    Fri 01 May 2015 13:54:36 -0000

Sample Output:
    25200
    88200

Explanation:
    In the first query, when we compare the time in UTC for both the time
    stamps, we see a difference of 7 hours. which is 7 X 3600 seconds or 25200
    seconds.

    Similarly, in the second query, time difference is 5 hours and 30 minutes
    for time zone adjusting for that we have a difference of 1 day and 30
    minutes. Or 24 X 3600 + 30 X 60 => 88200

# Solution:

import datetime


# Complete the time_delta function below.
def time_delta(time1, time2):
    time1 = datetime.datetime.strptime(time1, '%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z')
    time2 = datetime.datetime.strptime(time2, '%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z')

    return str(abs(int((time1 - time2).total_seconds())))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())

    for t_itr in range(t):
        t1 = input()

        t2 = input()

        delta = time_delta(t1, t2)

        print(delta + '\n')
