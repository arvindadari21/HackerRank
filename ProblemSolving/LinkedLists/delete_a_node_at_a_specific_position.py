"""
Question:

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and the position of a
node to delete. Delete the node at the given position and return the head node.
A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the
head and so on. The list may become empty after you delete the node.

Input Format:
    You have to complete the
    deleteNode(SinglyLinkedListNode* llist, int position) method which takes two
    arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node to
    delete. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. position will
    always be at least 0 and less than the number of the elements in the list.

    * The first line of input contains an integer n, denoting the number of
      elements in the linked list.
    * The next n lines contain an integer each in a new line, denoting the
      elements of the linked list in the order.
    * The last line contains an integer position denoting the position of the
      node that has to be deleted form the linked list.

Constraints:
    * 1 <= n <= 1000
    * 1 <= listi <= 1000; where listi is the ith element of the linked list.

Output Format:
    Delete the node at the given position and return the head of the updated
    linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

    The code in the editor will print the updated linked list in a single line
    separated by spaces.

Sample Input:
    8
    20
    6
    2
    19
    7
    4
    15
    9
    3

Sample Output:
    20 6 2 7 4 15 9

Explanation:
    The given linked list is 20->6->2->19->7->4->15->9. We have to delete the
    node at position 3, which is 19. After deleting that node, the updated
    linked list is: 20->6->2->7->4->15->9
