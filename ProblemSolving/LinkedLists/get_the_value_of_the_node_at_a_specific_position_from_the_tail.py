"""
Question:

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and a specific
position. Counting backwards from the tail node of the linked list, get the
value of the node at the given position. A position of 0 corresponds to the
tail, 1 corresponds to the node before the tail and so on.

Input Format:
You have to complete the
int getNode(SinglyLinkedListNode* head, int positionFromTail)
method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position
of the node from the tail. positionFromTail will be at least 0 and less than the
number of nodes in the list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

The first line will contain an integer t, the number of test cases.
Each test case has the following format:
    * The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the
      linked list.
    * The next n lines contains, an element each denoting the element of the
      linked list.
    * The last line contains an integer `position_from_tail` denoting the
      position from the tail, whose value needs to be found out and returned.

Constraints:
    * 1 <= t <= 10
    * 1 <= n <= 1000
    * 1 <= listi <= 1000, where listi is the ith element of the linked list.

Output Format:
    Find the node at the given position counting backwards from the tail. Then
    return the data contained in this node. Do NOT print anything to
    stdout/console.

    The code in the editor handles output.
    For each test case, print the value of the node, each in a new line.

Sample Input:
    2
    1
    1
    0
    3
    3
    2
    1
    2

Sample Output:
    1
    3

Explanation:
    In first case, there is one element in linked list with value 1. Hence, last
    element is 1.

    In second case, there are 3 elements with values 3, 2 and 1 (3 -> 2 -> 1).
    Hence, element with position of 2 from tail is 3.
